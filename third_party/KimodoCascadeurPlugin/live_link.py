"""Real-time motion from Blender into an open Cascadeur scene.

Runs inside Cascadeur, not Blender - so nothing in here imports bpy, and
Blender never imports it. Nothing is installed either: Blender posts this file's source
to the script server Cascadeur starts from its own commands menu, and
it lives in memory until Cascadeur closes. The Kimodo plugin in
`third_party` is a separate thing and is still installed the usual
way; this does not replace it and does not change it.

This is the fast half of the bridge. `ardy_stream.py` already streamed, but it
collected its chunks from `scene_idle`, and scene_idle is a **fixed three
second timer** - measured on 2026.2.1, focused and unfocused alike, gaps of
3001/3000/2999/2997/2998 ms. Three seconds is a delivery, not a live link.

Cascadeur ships PySide6, so a `QTimer` can be created from Python and runs on
Cascadeur's own Qt loop. Asked for 33 ms it comes back at about 21 Hz, and -
the part that decides whether any of this works - a scene write from inside
that tick succeeds: 40 of 40 `modify_update_with_session` calls returned True
at 0.26 ms each. So the tick can drive the scene, and the link is real-time.

Nothing here is installed. Blender posts this file's source to Cascadeur's own
MCP script server, which execs it once; from then on the QTimer and a small
HTTP receiver live inside Cascadeur until they are stopped. That removes the
Administrator copy into Program Files that the older receiver needed.

Two threads, and the line between them is the whole design. The HTTP thread
only ever appends to a queue or hands back something the timer left for it.
The QTimer, on Cascadeur's main thread, is the ONLY thing that may touch the
scene - reading included.

That rule has been broken once, by an endpoint that listed the scene's objects
straight from the HTTP thread with a comment saying reading names was safe. It
was not. Cascadeur died. If something needs to know about the scene, the timer
looks and leaves the answer behind.
