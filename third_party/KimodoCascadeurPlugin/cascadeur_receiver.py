"""Take poses from outside Cascadeur - Blender, or anything else - and key them.

The same shape as the ARDY stream, and for the same reason: a write costs about
the same whether it carries one frame or a thousand, because the cost is in the
modify session rather than the values. Measured, a single-pose write settles at
roughly 2 Hz no matter how fast it is asked for, while forty frames of
twenty-seven joints land in 0.09 s in one call. So this takes ranges, not
frames, and there is no attempt at mirroring a rig pose-by-pose.

    GET  /health
    POST /pose   {"path": "<npz>"}          a chunk already on disk
    POST /pose   {"bone_names": [...], ...} the arrays inline as JSON

The file form is the fast one and what Blender uses; the JSON form is there so
the link can be tried from a terminal.

Chunks are queued and written from `scene_idle`, never from the HTTP thread:
the scene is not thread-safe. Start it with the Receive Poses command.
