"""Write an ARDY motion chunk straight onto the ARDY.casc rig.

This replaces the old route, which baked every chunk to FBX in a headless
Blender and imported that. The chunk is already numbers - joint rotations and
positions - and Cascadeur's rig takes numbers, so the detour bought nothing
and cost a Blender launch per chunk.

Four things have to be right, and each one of them fails quietly on its own:

1. The animation has to be long enough BEFORE anything is written, or every
   set_data_value is refused with "last frame in animation is 0".

2. ARDY's global_rot_mats are NOT world orientations. They are rotations
   against a rest pose where every joint's orientation is identity, so the
   world orientation is `R_ardy @ R_rest`. R_rest comes from the rig's own
   inverse bind matrices - measured, not guessed. Skip it and the hands come
   out rotated by exactly 180 degrees, which is what the wrists looked like.

3. Values go through the joint's Transform behaviour, not through
   root_group().node_deep("Position"). Writing the nodes directly pins the
   joints and Cascadeur then hides the AutoPosing controllers - the animation
   plays, but the character can no longer be posed. The Transform behaviour is
   the channel Cascadeur's own BVH importer uses.

4. Keyframes have to be seeded on EVERY layer, not just the layers the joints
   belong to. ARDY.casc spreads its rig over thirteen; the ten that hold the
   AutoPosing controllers would otherwise be left empty.

global_position is in centimetres and in the same frame as everything else.
(local_position is metres in a frame rotated -90 degrees about X - correct,
but there is no reason to work in it.)
