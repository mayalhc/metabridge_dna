"""ARDY generating continuously into an open Cascadeur scene.

Two clocks have to be kept apart. The model runs on a worker thread, because a
chunk takes about half a second of blocking HTTP and doing that on Cascadeur's
thread freezes the window. The scene is written from Cascadeur's own idle
event, because the scene is not thread-safe and nothing else may touch it.
The queue between them is the whole design.

Measured on an RTX 5080, 8 diffusion steps:

    generate one chunk      0.49 s      (median of five, 0.48-0.59)
    apply it to the rig     0.09 s
    ------------------------------
    total per chunk         0.58 s
    chunk plays for         2.00 s      (40 frames at 20 fps)

So generation runs about four times faster than playback, and the queue grows
rather than starves. `scene_idle` fires at 2 Hz, which is twice per chunk of
work - enough to collect them promptly without polling hard.

This is only possible because chunks are written straight onto the rig. The
route this replaced baked every chunk to FBX in a headless Blender, seconds
per chunk, and no amount of queueing hides that.

**Cascadeur's playback and scene_idle do not run together.** Press play during
a run and the chunks stop arriving until it is paused again - idle is exactly
what playback takes over. So there is no watching a take build under a moving
playhead, and no point building for it: keys land as they are generated, and
what is on screen is whatever frame the playhead is parked on. Starting
playback from here is not possible either, so it cannot be worked around from
this side: ActionManager.call_action accepts any string, known or not, and
nine plausible names for the play action all returned successfully having done
nothing.
