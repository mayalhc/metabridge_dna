"""ARDY Live - motion generation for Cascadeur, built up as a list of takes.

Build a list of takes ("walk" for 120 frames, then "run" for 80), press
Generate, and get the whole thing as one continuous motion in a scene of its
own, skeleton and body mesh included.

The takes are chained inside the ARDY service, not here - each take starts
from the previous take's own last frames as history, which is what an
autoregressive model is for, and what makes "walk" flow into "run" instead of
cutting between two separate clips. That placement is deliberate. Joining
motion on the Cascadeur side was tried first, through Cascadeur's own
View.Retargeting_Copy/Paste actions, and it crashed Cascadeur every time
(access violation at one fixed address in presenter_lib.dll; a settle delay
between every step changed nothing, ruling out a timing race). Retargeting is
built for Cascadeur's Rig system, and a bare imported ARDY skeleton has no rig
at all. Stitching in torch instead sidesteps that entirely: one chunk arrives
already whole.

The result lands on the ARDY.casc sample character (Cascadeur's samples
folder, same place Kimodo.casc lives for the Kimodo roundtrip) rather than a
freshly imported skeleton. ARDY.casc already carries a Cascadeur rig built for
ARDY's skeleton, so each Generate loads that sample scene fresh via
ProjectLoader.load_from() and then writes the motion onto it directly - see
ardy_apply.py.

There is no FBX anywhere in that path any more, and no Blender. Every chunk
used to be baked to FBX by a headless Blender launched per chunk, then handed
to import_animation() to be parsed back into the numbers it started as. It was
the slowest step in the loop and the most fragile: a drift between the FBX's
root name and the rig's was reported only as "No object with id cskel27 was
found in import data" in the event log, while the call itself returned
normally.

The ARDY service is started separately, with start_ardy.bat, never from here.
An early version launched it with subprocess.Popen inside a dialog callback,
blocking for several seconds while the model loaded, and Cascadeur died on
that call every time (STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN in ucrtbase.dll, two crash
dumps). Everything this file sends the service is a plain HTTP request to
something already running.
